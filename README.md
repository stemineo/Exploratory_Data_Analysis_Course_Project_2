# Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 2

This is my repository for the Coursera's course Exploratory Data Analysis. It includes 12 files for the Course Project 2, 6 plots in .png format and 6 R scripts to generate each of the plots, having the same names of the plots.

To run the scripts you have to:

1.    Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R, R, plot5.R, plot6.R) to some directory;   
2.    Download the data from the following link and extract it to the same directory where the scripts are:
[National Emissions Inventory](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/dataNEI_data.zip) [29Mb];
3.    Run the scripts.

The project assignment and the description of the data can be found here:
